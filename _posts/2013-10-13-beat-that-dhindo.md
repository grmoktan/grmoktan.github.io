The [Rice episode](https://youtu.be/FApyQqrwLE0?t=87) got me thinking how I myself explain Nepali cuisine to others. I of-course start with Rice. Then I add Daal and Tarkari and Momos and Chowmein and Thukpa etc ... and I generally describe them being some form of lentil, Curry, dumplings, Wok, Ramen, etc... respectively. 


Then I picture Dhindo and I am like ... "hmm it's sort of like mashed potatoes but not quite and it doesn't taste of anything but its delicous with tarkari and achaar...um it's made of grinded barley-ish  thingies ...". 


Can't think of anything similar to Dhindo. It's just Dhindo or call it Dhedo/Dhendo ..whatever. If you know of anything similar please enlighten me.


And to anyone who wants to make it at home but thinks it is a muscular job to make it, worry no more... Ustaad discovered a trick.  As I said, it's made from grinded barley-ish thingies. Buckwheat, Millet, corn/maize..works. Basically you boil water and put the flour in and stir. The stirring process is the trick. You don't want the freaking bubbles of dry flour powder or pebbled dough in your Dhindo.  And you have to do it in a limited time frame as well. From boiling water and before your Dhindo get burnt. And using a spatula to obtain the smooth grained Dhindo in that little time is very muscle power consuming. 


Behold the Dhindo-beater:

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_gen/egg_beater.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    </div>
</div>
So here is what I do: 



1. My choice of Dhindo is the "Phapar ko Dhindo". What is Phapar you say? ... Google says it is called buckwheat. I get this from Hamro Bazzar-Helsinki.


2. Boil water 


3. Put some Butter in the boiling water


4. Start putting the Phapar flour in the boiling water whilst stirring it with an egg-beater now forever known as Dhindo-beater. 


5. Keep adding flour and beat the mix till you get a smooth texture.


6. Take it out and serve.



Golveda ko achaar and chicken curry and yogurt on the side... Deliciousness... OMG!!



So Beat that Dhindo, Ustaad Style !! Cheers!!!
