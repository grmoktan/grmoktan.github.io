Loved Narayan Gopal from the very beginning ... the man had a great voice ... no doubt ... feelings in every song were amazing ... now listening to this particular song([Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjiZYs3p5cI)) "Mero behosi aaja ..." led me to think ... lots of people suffer from this process ... it might be a good thing ... or not ... I'm not sure.


The high that you get by living life ... or the high of love ... keeps you protected from the hardships of life ... so true ... like a shield.

Someone said "love is life" ... how? ... love has many forms ... for a start, if you don't love yourself, you won't be living for long ... that may be the reason for those idiots commiting suicide ... yes, this kind of reasoning works ... you have life because you love yourself ... you do anything to keep yourself happy ... to protect yourself.

Then, you have love for others ... your family ... you want to protect them, keep them happy ... then, you have friends ... the process of spreading your love begins ... you love, the nature ... you love, animals ... you love, the mountains ... you love, the snow ... you love, the rain ... you love. 

And it is quite a nice thing actually ... so on it goes.

<blockquote>
But then again, life is not all love ... you wish it was, but it isn't ... survival of the fittest ... competition ... work ... bad boss ... pollution ... politics ... fights ... the list keeps on going ... till infinity.
</blockquote>
So many external factors, that hinder your wish to fill your life just with pure love ... damn. 

These pollute your pure heart with the evil stuffs ... it instills hatred, jealousy...whatever ... your life starts getting doomed ... your heart feels heavy.

So ... what keeps you going inspite of these awful stuffs ... is the high you get by living life ... the high of love ... you keep getting back to loving yourself ... and the others around you ... this shields you from the bad stuffs.

I felt this from this song ... so I sing "Mero behosi aaja, mero laagi parda bho ... Chopiye peera sabai, dukha sabai parda bho..."
