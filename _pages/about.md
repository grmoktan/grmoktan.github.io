Currently, I am responsible for the AI/ML infra-services, Data & Analytics topics in the Nokia Engineering and Services Cloud (NESC) team.

Obtained my doctorate in networking technology from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-communications-and-networking), Finland. My advisor was [Jukka Manner](https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/jukka-manner) and I worked on resources sharing mechanisms w.r.t. network data transport.

Contracted a serious knack for data throughout my industry and academic research life. I find myself exploring, learning and developing continuously across a broad spectrum of technical, business and societal topics of communications networks, data and services. 

I also dabble with some amateur photography hobby, ðŸ“¸!
